 DuinOS MoreComplexBlinking
 
 Blinks two LEDs. One LED shows two combined waves.
 
 The circuit: ##Pins:
 * LED connected from digital pin 14 to Vcc.
 * LED connected from digital pin 15 to Vcc.

 ##Pins:
 * Note: On most Comm.ProgUSB boards, there are already two LEDs on the board
 connected to pins 14 and 15, so you don't need any extra components for this example.
